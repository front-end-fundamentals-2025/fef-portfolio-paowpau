                    <p>This is an image I created using an AI called Midjourney. I was attending a design course focused on creating art with AI.</p> 
                    <p>This is an illustration of Van Gogh in his style. You achieve this by creating prompts.</p>

                    <p>This is a part of a game I was developing using AI-generated prompts.</p>
                    <p>The image showcases the games box design, which was created to reflect the theme and atmosphere of the gameplay.</p> 
                    <p>By carefully crafting prompts, I was able to generate visuals that aligned with my creative vision, making AI a powerful tool in the design process.</p>

                    <p>This is a cartoon monkey character that I designed and illustrated using my iPad. I created it from scratch, focusing on making it fun and expressive.</p>  
                    <p>This piece was a great way to practice character design and have fun with creativity</p>

                    <p>This is a drawing I created after seeing my friend, capturing their surprised expression.</p> 
                    <p>I wanted to focus on the raw, spontaneous emotion in that moment.</p>

                    <p>This is a cartoon illustration of an old man with an angry or tired expression. 
                    <p>I didnt have any specific inspiration for this piece. I just let my creativity flow and had fun bringing the character to life.</p>
